Different resolutions can be asked for.

For a 16U image,
Threshold computation is always the same if using 32F.
With 16U, calculation of threshold loose precision and we might have small differences if numbers are rounded up or down.


Determining Threshold :
percentile might be derived from the histogram (so less data need to be stored)
but we then we sort all the pixels to figure out the pixel intensity at which we can cut off, that is extremely inefficient
since we need to sort billions of pixels in ascending order, and stored the result.
